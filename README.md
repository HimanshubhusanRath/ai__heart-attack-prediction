**HEART ATTACK PREDICTION**

The problem here is to predict if there is a chance of heart attack based on certain input data.
This is a classification problem.


In '_Heart-Attack-Prediction-v2-multiple-models.ipynb_', we can learn the below concepts.

* Training different types of models for this classification problem. Below models are considered here.
    1. LR (Logistic Regression)
    2. SVC (Support Vector Machine Classifier)
    3. KNN (K-nearest Neighbour)
    4. GNB (Gaussian Naive Bayes)
    5. DTC (Decision Tree Classifier)
    6. SGDC (SGD Classifier)
    7. ADC (AdaBoost Classifier)
    8. RF (Random Forest Classifier)
    9. LGBN (LGBM Classifier)
    10. PAC (Passive Aggressive Classifier)
    11. XGB (Gradient Boosting Classifier) 
* Preparing a report on the input data using **pandas profiling** module.
